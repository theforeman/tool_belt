# Prepare the build environment

* [ ] Clone https://github.com/theforeman/pulpcore-packaging
* [ ] [Configure](https://github.com/theforeman/pulpcore-packaging/tree/rpm/<%= release %>/automation#configure) the build environment
* [ ] [Build](https://github.com/theforeman/pulpcore-packaging/tree/rpm/<%= release %>/automation#build) the container

# Create/update packages in `pulpcore-packaging`

* [ ] [Run](https://github.com/theforeman/pulpcore-packaging/tree/rpm/<%= release %>/automation#run) the container:
  ```
  ./update_packaging.sh
  ```
  This will place the results in a newly created directory `./packaging`.
* [ ] Inspect the generated RPM specs, adjust them if needed
* [ ] Open a PR with the changes

## Update python-pulp_2to3_migration

The `python-pulp_2to3_migration` package is named differently due to a tito bug (the PyPI name uses dashes, not underscores). Due to this, the regular process of updating it cannot be used.

* [ ] Have a regular `pulpcore-packaging` clone
* [ ] Run `obal update python-pulp_2to3_migration --version X.Y.Z`
* [ ] As `obal` does not update dependencies, verify those are in sync with `setup.py`

# Update to a new pulpcore release

* [ ] Create a new `rpm/<%= release %>` branch in `pulpcore-packaging` by using the previous release branch as a base: `git checkout -b rpm/<%= release %> rpm/<%= previous %>`
* [ ] Set that branch as the new default branch in GitHub
* [ ] Update `package_manifest.yaml`, `rel-eng/releasers.conf`, `rel-eng/tito.props`, `repoclosure/yum.conf`, `automation/_generate_deps.sh` to use the new <%= release %> release (a simple `sed -i 's/<%= previous.sub('.', '\\.') %>/<%= release %>/g' â€¦` is usually sufficient)
* [ ] Add <%= release %> to `theforeman.org/yaml/includes/pulpcore_versions.yaml.inc` in [jenkins-jobs](https://github.com/theforeman/jenkins-jobs).
* [ ] Trigger the [`pulpcore-packaging-rpm-<%= release %>`](https://ci.theforeman.org/job/pulpcore-packaging-rpm-<%= release %>-release/) job once, so that GitHub hooks are properly set up.
* [ ] Update `automation/requirements.txt` to the new required versions
* [ ] Run normal "create/update" procedure above

# Signing packages

Any change to packaging requires signing, as otherwise the repo can't be published.

* [ ] Sign the RPMs in the release, pass `PROJECT=pulpcore` and `VERSION=<%= release %>` to every invocation.
  * [ ] [Download](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman-rel-eng/blob/master/download_rpms)
  * [ ] [Sign](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman-rel-eng/blob/master/sign_rpms)
  * [ ] [Upload RPM signatures](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman-rel-eng/blob/master/upload_rpm_signatures)
  * [ ] [Upload RPMs](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman-rel-eng/blob/master/upload_rpms)
