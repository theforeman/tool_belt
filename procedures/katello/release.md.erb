* Release Engineer: <%= engineer %>

# When Ready to Release

## Release Owner

- [ ] Request Hammer CLI Katello release from maintainers
- [ ] Request Virt Who Configure release from maintainers
- [ ] Request any other releases as needed from the release owners (consult the `:repos:` section of `configs/katello/<%= short_version %>.yaml`)
<% unless is_first_rc -%>
- [ ] Do Cherry-picks: Clone [tool_belt](https://github.com/theforeman/tool_belt)
  - [ ] If any minor versions of Katello have been added to Redmine since the last cherry-pick, make sure to include them in `prior_releases` in configs/katello/<%= short_version %>.yaml
  - [ ] Run `./tools.rb setup-environment configs/katello/<%= short_version %>.yaml`
  - [ ] Run `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<secret> ./tools.rb cherry-picks --version <%= full_version %> configs/katello/<%= short_version %>.yaml`
  - [ ] Open a PR in Katello release branch.  Make sure the PR name starts with [CP] to prevent our automations from adding it to Redmine issues.
  - [ ] Using `git cherry-pick -x` as needed, verify tickets in the cherry_picks_<%= full_version %> file are accounted for, or additionally cherry-pick them.  Recommended: Do this in tool_belt's checkout of Katello, in `repos/katello/<%= full_version %>/katello`. This way when you run cherry-picks again, tool_belt will be aware of any picks already completed.
  - [ ] For any cherry-picks that are not needed (including Redmine trackers) you can add them to the `:ignores:` section of `tool_belt` in `configs/katello/<%= short_version %>.yaml`
<% end -%>
<% unless is_rc -%>
- [ ] Change Redmine version <%= full_version %> state to Closed
<% end -%>
- [ ] Check for outdated deprecation warnings in the current and next release with `./tools check-deprecation-warnings configs/katello/<%= short_version %>.yaml`. Follow the instructions in the output of the command. Don't forget to create any Redmine issues needed!
- [ ] Update [docs.theforeman.org](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-documentation)
  - Ensure [release notes](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-documentation/blob/<%= foreman_version %>/guides/doc-Release_Notes/katello.adoc) are correct
    - Headline features: important features with a few sentences description each
    - Upgrade notes: all important notices that users must be aware of before upgrading
    - Deprecations: features that will be removed or changed in a future version
  - Using [redmine_release_notes](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-documentation/blob/<%= foreman_version %>/guides/doc-Release_Notes/redmine_release_notes) script (see [README](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-documentation/blob/<%= short_version %>/guides/doc-Release_Notes/README.md) as well): `./guides/doc-Release_Notes/redmine_release_notes katello <%= version %> > ./guides/doc-Release_Notes/topics/katello-<%= version %>.adoc`
<% unless is_rc && !full_version.end_with?('1') -%>
  - Add `topics/katello-<%= version %>.adoc` to `guides/doc-Release_Notes/master.adoc`: `sed '/x.y.z releases here/a include::topics/katello-<%= version %>.adoc[leveloffset=+1]' master.adoc`
<% end -%>
  - Make sure [katello-contributors.adoc](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-documentation/blob/<%= foreman_version %>/guides/doc-Release_Notes/topics/katello-contributors.adoc) is updated
  - Submit this as a PR

- [ ] Open a PR (or use cherry-pick PR) against the release branch which updates `lib/katello/version.rb` to <%= full_version %>:
  - [ ] `git pull` to make sure you have the latest changes
  - [ ] `sed '/VERSION/ s/".\+"/"<%= full_version %>"/' lib/katello/version.rb`
  - [ ] Update/add the CHANGELOG.md file: `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<secret> ./tools changelog configs/katello/<%= short_version %>.yaml`
  - [ ] Commit: `git commit -m "Release <%= full_version %>"`
  - [ ] Ensure that the commit above is the _last_ commit and there are no commits after it. This is the commit that will get tagged. (Rearrange commits with `git rebase -i` if needed.)
- [ ] Once the PR is merged, perform the following in the Katello release branch (the real one, not your fork):
  - [ ] Tag: `git tag -s -m "Release <%= full_version %>" <%= full_version %>`
  - [ ] Push: `git push --follow-tags` (Must be pushed directly to the release branch, as pull request merges will not preserve tags.)
  - [ ] Generate .mo translation files: `make -C locale all-mo` in the katello directory
  - [ ] Generate source gem: `gem build katello.gemspec`
  - [ ] Ensure you have a working login and password at rubygems.org
  - [ ] Push gem: `gem push katello-<%= full_version %>.gem`
- [ ] Inform the delivery team that the gem is published

# Once Source is Available
<% unless is_rc -%>

**Note** it is considered good practice to release on a day when the next day is a working day. This means no releases on Fridays or on the day before a holiday.
