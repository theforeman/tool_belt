# When Ready to Release

## Release Owner

- [ ] Request Hammer CLI Katello release from maintainers
- [ ] Request Virt Who Configure release from maintainers
<% unless is_rc %>- [ ] Change Redmine version <%= full_version %> state to Closed
<% end %>
- [ ] Do Cherry-picks: Clone [tool_belt](https://github.com/theforeman/tool_belt) and run:
  - [ ] `./tools.rb setup-environment configs/katello/<%= short_version %>.yaml`
  - [ ] `./tools.rb cherry-picks --version <%= full_version %> configs/katello/<%= short_version %>.yaml`
  - [ ] Open a PR in Katello release branch.  Make sure the PR name starts with [CP]
  - [ ] Using `git cherry-pick -x` as needed, verify tickets in the cherry_picks_<%= full_version %> file are accounted for or additionally cherry pick them
  - [ ] For any cherry-picks that are not needed (including Redmine trackers) you can add them to the `:ignores:` section of `tool_belt` in `configs/katello/<%= short_version %>.yaml`
- [ ] Check for outdated deprecation warnings in the current and next release with `./tools check-deprecation-warnings configs/katello/<%= short_version %>.yaml`. Follow the instructions in the output of the command.

- [ ] Bump version:
  - [ ] Open a PR (or use cherry-pick PR) which updates `lib/katello/version.rb` to <%= full_version %>
  - [ ] Commit: `git commit -m "Release <%= full_version %>"`
- [ ] In Katello release branch (the real one, not your fork), once PR is merged:
  - [ ] Tag: `git tag -s -m "Release <%= full_version %>" <%= full_version %>`
  - [ ] Push: `git push upstream --follow-tags` (Must be pushed directly to the release branch, as pull request merges will not preserve tags.)
  - [ ] Generate source gem: `gem build katello.gemspec`
  - [ ] Ensure you have a working login and password at rubygems.org
  - [ ] Push gem: `gem push katello-<%= full_version %>.gem`
- [ ] Email the delivery team informing them that the gem is published
- [ ] Confirm response that the build succeeded (or if necessary, do more cherry-picks and version bumps repeating the steps above)

# Once Source is Available
<% unless is_rc -%>

**Note** it is considered good practice to release on a day when the next day is a working day. This means no releases on Fridays or on the day before a holiday.
<% end -%>
