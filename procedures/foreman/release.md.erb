## Installer Maintainer

- [ ] Make patch releases of installer modules that have important changes
  - Branch to MAJ.MIN-stable if recent changes to the module aren't suitable for patch (x.y.z) release
<% end -%>

## Release Owner

<% unless is_rc -%>
- [ ] Add a new [Redmine version](https://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/settings/versions) for the next minor, unless the series is EOL. Be sure the version is set to sharing with subprojects.
<% end -%>
- [ ] Remove/change target version field for any open Redmine tickets assigned to the release still (next minor, unset it or reject)
- [ ] Ensure that code in git matches issues fixed in <%= full_version %> in redmine. [issues.rb](https://gist.github.com/tbrisker/3320097f1d8c9abfb2dbcf8d8e216bba) can be used to generate a comparison between the two.
<% unless is_rc -%>
- [ ] Change Redmine version <%= full_version %> state to Closed
<% end -%>

# Tagging a release: <%= target_date %>

## Release Owner

- [ ] Make sure [test_<%= short_version.tr('.', '_') %>_stable](https://ci.theforeman.org/job/test_<%= short_version.tr('.', '_') %>_stable/) and [smart-proxy<%= short_version %>-stable-test](https://ci.theforeman.org/job/smart-proxy-<%= short_version %>-stable-test/) are green using [verify_green_jobs](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman-rel-eng/blob/master/verify_green_jobs)
<% if is_rc || is_first_ga -%>
- [ ] Run `make -C locale tx-update` in foreman <%= short_version %>-stable
<% end -%>
<% unless is_first_rc -%>
- [ ] Update release version similar to [here](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman-rel-eng/commit/2029a9688da00d9c385c3438dd71b594ba5f728e)
<% end -%>
- Tag the projects
  - [ ] Create tags [tag_project](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman-rel-eng/blob/master/tag_project)
  - [ ] Push tags [tag_push](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman-rel-eng/blob/master/tag_push)
- [ ] Run the Jenkins [Tarballs Release](https://ci.theforeman.org/job/tarballs-release/) using [release_tarballs](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman-rel-eng/blob/master/release_tarballs) to create tarballs

## Release Engineer

- Sign Tarballs
  - [ ] [Download](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman-rel-eng/blob/master/download_tarballs)
  - [ ] [Inspect](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman-rel-eng/blob/master/inspect_tarballs)
  - [ ] [Sign and upload detached signatures](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman-rel-eng/blob/master/sign_tarballs)

Note: If for some reason there was an issue with the tarballs that required uploading new tarballs, CDN cache should be invalidated so that the builders use the updated tarballs.

# Packaging a release: <%= target_date %>
<% unless is_rc -%>

**Note** it is considered good practice to release on a day when the next day is a working day. This means no releases on Fridays or on the day before a holiday.
