# Branching

## Release Engineer

- [ ] Branch RPM packaging using [tool_belt](https://github.com/theforeman/tool_belt)
  - [ ] Create `configs/foreman/<%= release %>.yaml` based on the nightly and previous release. Ensure that any `based_on` entries are filled out and pointing to nightly version of tag.

      bundle exec ./tools.rb mash-scripts configs/foreman/<%= release %>.yaml
      sed -i '/strict_keys/ s/True/False/' mash_scripts/foreman/<%= release %>.0/foreman-plugins-<%= release %>-*.mash
      ```
    - [ ] Open PR with new config and mash scripts for review
  - [ ] Clone tags and create build targets in Koji: `bundle exec ./tools.rb koji --commit configs/foreman/<%= release %>.yaml`
  - [ ] Create a `rpm/<%= release %>` branch in [foreman-packaging](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-packaging) based on `rpm/develop`
- [ ] Branch Debian packaging
  - [ ] Clone Debian nightly repos to <%= release %> using [copy/freight instructions](https://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/Debian_Packaging#Branching-for-release)
  - [ ] Create a `deb/<%= release %>` branch in [foreman-packaging](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-packaging) based on `deb/develop`

## Release Owner

- [ ] Create <%= release %>-stable branches
  - [ ] [foreman](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman)
  - [ ] [foreman-installer](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-installer)
    - [ ] `bundle exec rake pin_modules && sed -i '/Puppetfile.lock/d' .gitignore && bundle exec librarian-puppet install && git add Puppetfile*`
  - [ ] [foreman-selinux](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-selinux)

The next step should only be done after all branching, including packaging, has completed.

- [ ] Bump versions to <%= develop %>-develop
  `echo <%= develop %>.0-develop > VERSION`
  - [ ] [foreman](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman)
  Also change package.json version field to <%= develop %>.0
  - [ ] [foreman-installer](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-installer)

# Preparing build systems

## Release engineer

    - [ ] Set to version `<%= develop %>.0`, reset release to `1` in `packages/foreman/foreman{,-{installer,proxy,release,selinux}}/*.spec` and `packages/foreman/rubygem-hammer_cli{,_foreman}/*.spec`. Then create a changelog using `obal changelog --message '- Bump version to <%= develop %>-develop' foreman{,-{installer,proxy,release,selinux}} rubygem-hammer_cli{,_foreman}`
  - [ ] deb/develop: `scripts/changelog.rb -v <%= develop %>.0-1 -m "Bump changelog to <%= develop %>.0 to match VERSION" debian/*/*/changelog`
- [ ] Prepare build systems for <%= release %> release:
  - [ ] foreman-packaging's rpm/<%= release %>
    - [ ] Update `packages/foreman/foreman-release/foreman.gpg`, `mock/*.cfg`, `package_manifest.yaml`, `rel-eng/{releasers.conf,tito.props}` and `repoclosure/*.conf`
  - [ ] Create mash configuration on Koji, from tool_belt checkout:
    ```
    scp mash_scripts/foreman/<%= release %>.0/*.mash root@koji.katello.org:/etc/mash/

    - [ ] Create a `<%= release %>.groovy` in `pipelines/vars/foreman/` describing the operating systems the release supports
    - [ ] Add `<%= release %>` to the version list in `yaml/jobs/pipeline/foreman-release.yaml`
    - [ ] Create `test_<%= release.tr('.', '_') %>_stable.yaml` and `test_proxy_<%= release.tr('.', '_') %>_stable.yaml` in `yaml/jobs/`
    - [ ] Remove the oldest version to keep last 3 from the files/directories in the previous steps
- [ ] Add <%= release %> to [Forklift versions config](https://github.com/theforeman/forklift/blob/master/vagrant/config/versions.yaml)

# Other systems

## Release Owner

- [ ] Create release schedule page for next version (<%= develop %>) linked from [Development_Resources](https://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/Development_Resources) and post planned schedule on Discourse.
- Create Redmine versions
  - [ ] Add next version number (<%= develop %>.0) and make sure it is shared with subprojects in [foreman](https://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/settings/versions)
  - [ ] Add first patch release (<%= release %>.1) and make sure it is shared with subprojects in [foreman](https://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/settings/versions)
- [ ] Ensure current Foreman deprecations for the next release are removed in __develop__

This was based on the [wiki procedure](https://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/Release_Process#Branching-for-series) and sometimes has a bit more info.
