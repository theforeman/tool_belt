# Branching: <%= target_date %>

## Release Engineer

- Branch RPM packaging using [tool_belt](https://github.com/theforeman/tool_belt)
  - [ ] Clone tags and create build targets in Koji: `bundle exec ./tools.rb koji --commit configs/foreman/<%= release %>.yaml`
    Note that you must use koji client < 1.30 since clone-tag was changed and our Koji server is too old. See https://docs.pagure.org/koji/release_notes/release_notes_1.30/#system-changes for details.
  - [ ] Create a `rpm/<%= release %>` branch in [foreman-packaging](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-packaging) based on `rpm/develop`
- Branch Debian packaging
  - [ ] Clone Debian nightly repos to <%= release %> using [copy/freight instructions](https://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/Debian_Packaging#Branching-for-release)
  - [ ] Create a `deb/<%= release %>` branch in [foreman-packaging](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-packaging) based on `deb/develop`

## Release Owner

- [ ] Create <%= release %>-stable branches using [branch_project](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman-rel-eng/blob/master/branch_project)

- [ ] Branch foreman-documentation git repository and update website for new release by following the [README instructions](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-documentation#branching-new-release)
- [ ] Ask Hammer maintainer to branch [hammer-cli](https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-cli) and [hammer-cli-foreman](https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-cli-foreman)

The next step should only be done after all branching, including packaging, has completed.

- [ ] Bump versions to <%= develop %>-develop using [develop_branch_bump](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman-rel-eng/blob/master/develop_branch_bump)
- [ ] Push version bumps to <%= develop %>-develop using [develop_branch_push](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman-rel-eng/blob/master/develop_branch_push)
- [ ] Ask Hammer maintainer to bump [hammer-cli](https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-cli) and [hammer-cli-foreman](https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-cli-foreman)

# Preparing build systems: <%= target_date %>

## Release engineer

- [ ] Merge the earlier created [jenkins-jobs PR](https://github.com/theforeman/jenkins-jobs/pulls) that creates the release pipelines
- [ ] Update foreman-packaging rpm/develop to ensure nightlies build:
  - [ ] rpm/develop:

    - [ ] Set to version `<%= develop %>.0`, reset release to `1` in `packages/foreman/foreman{,-{installer,proxy,release,selinux}}/*.spec` and `packages/foreman/rubygem-hammer_cli{,_foreman}/*.spec`. Then create a changelog using `obal changelog --message '- Bump version to <%= develop %>-develop' foreman{,-{installer,proxy,release,selinux}} rubygem-hammer_cli{,_foreman}`
  - [ ] deb/develop: `scripts/changelog.rb -v <%= develop %>.0-1 -m "Bump changelog to <%= develop %>.0 to match VERSION" debian/*/*/changelog`
- [ ] Prepare build systems for <%= release %> release:
  - [ ] foreman-packaging's rpm/<%= release %>
    - [ ] Update `packages/foreman/foreman-release/foreman.gpg`, `mock/*.cfg`, `package_manifest.yaml` and `repoclosure/*.conf`
  - [ ] foreman-packaging's deb/<%= release %>
    - [ ] Update `debian/*/foreman-release/theforeman-archive-keyring.asc` from https://deb.theforeman.org/foreman.asc, you will only see changes if the key was recently updated.
- [ ] Trigger the [`foreman-packaging-rpm-<%= release %>`](https://ci.theforeman.org/job/foreman-packaging-rpm-<%= release %>-release/) job once, so that GitHub hooks are properly set up.
- [ ] Trigger the [`foreman-packaging-deb-<%= release %>`](https://ci.theforeman.org/job/foreman-packaging-deb-<%= release %>-release/) job once, so that GitHub hooks are properly set up.

# Other systems: <%= target_date %>

## Release Owner

- [ ] Create a `Foreman <%= develop %> Schedule and Planning` post on [Development/Releases](https://community.theforeman.org/c/development/releases/20) using [schedule](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman-rel-eng/blob/master/schedule)
- [ ] Create Redmine version <%= develop %>.0 and make sure it is shared with subprojects in [foreman](https://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/settings/versions)
- [ ] Ensure current Foreman deprecations for the next release are removed in __develop__

This was based on the [wiki procedure](https://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/Release_Process#Branching-for-series) and sometimes has a bit more info.
